3. While the veggies are cooking, pulse the cauliflower florets in a food processor until a ricelike texture is achieved. Add the cauliflower rice to the sautéed vegetables, along with the salt, tomato paste and tamari and sauté until tender, about 10 minutes more. Add the beans, if using. Stir occasionally while cooking to prevent sticking.
